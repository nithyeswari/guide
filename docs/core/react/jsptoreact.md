I'd be happy to help you replace your JSP/JSPF system with a React implementation while maintaining the same Ajax functionality.

Let me create a 

## Implementation Guide

To replace your JSP/JSPF with React while maintaining the same Ajax functionality:

1. **Set up React in your project**:
   - Install React via npm/yarn if you haven't already
   - Set up a build system (webpack, Vite, etc.) to compile your React code

2. **Integration approach**:
   - You can either replace your entire JSP page with React, or
   - Incrementally migrate by mounting React components in specific areas

3. **Key components I've provided**:
   - `AjaxContent.jsx`: Handles fetching HTML content via Ajax and rendering it
   - `AjaxForm.jsx`: Handles form submissions via Ajax
   - `MyReactPage.jsx`: Example of how to structure navigation and content areas

4. **Using the same Ajax endpoints**:
   - These components are designed to work with your existing JSP endpoints
   - They maintain the same Ajax request format your backend expects

5. **Security note**:
   - The components use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the HTML returned from your Ajax calls
   - Ensure your backend properly sanitizes HTML to prevent XSS attacks

6. **Gradual migration strategy**:
   - Add `<div id="react-root"></div>` to your JSP pages where you want React to render
   - Replace sections of your JSP one at a time while maintaining overall functionality

Would you like me to provide any additional components or explanations for your specific JSP structure?
