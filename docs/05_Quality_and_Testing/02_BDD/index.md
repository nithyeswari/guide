# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

This guide provides an overview of BDD and a tool for recording user actions to generate Gherkin feature files.

## User Action Recorder

The User Action Recorder is a browser-based tool that captures user interactions with a web page and automatically generates Gherkin-format feature files for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). This helps bridge the gap between manual testing and automated test scenarios.

### How to Use

1.  **Setup Information**: Enter a descriptive Feature Name and Scenario Name.
2.  **Recording Actions**: Click "Start Recording" and perform the user actions.
3.  **Review and Edit**: Review the captured steps and edit the "Then" step to specify the expected outcome.
4.  **Generate Feature File**: Click "Generate Feature File" to create the Gherkin syntax.
