### 11. 🔍 Component Patterns Layer

React component design patterns and architectural approaches.

#### Patterns:
- **Compound Components**: Components that work together to form a complete UI
  ```jsx
  <Select>
    <Select.Trigger />
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option value="1">Option 1</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select>
  ```

- **Render Props**: Share code between components using a prop whose value is a function
  ```jsx
  <DataFetcher 
    render={(data) => <UserProfile userData={data} />} 
  />
  ```

- **Higher-Order Components**: Compose components for reusable logic
  ```jsx
  const withLogger = (Component) => (props) => {
    console.log(`Rendering ${Component.displayName}`);
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
  ```

- **Custom Hooks**: Extract and reuse stateful logic
  ```jsx
  function useWindowSize() {
    const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });
    // Implementation...
    return size;
  }
  ```

- **State Machines**: Model component state transitions explicitly
  ```jsx
  const stateMachine = {
    initial: 'idle',
    states: {
      idle: { on: { FETCH: 'loading' } },
      loading: { 
        on: { 
          SUCCESS: 'success',
          ERROR: 'error'
        }
      },
      // More states...
    }
  };
  ```

- **Context Modules**: Organize related context, reducer, and actions
  ```jsx
  // auth-context.js
  export const AuthContext = createContext();
  export const authReducer = (state, action) => { /* ... */ };
  export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
  ```

- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separate data and presentation
  ```jsx
  // Container
  const UserListContainer = () => {
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
    // Fetch users...
    return <UserList users={users} />;
  };
  
  // Presentational
  const UserList = ({ users }) => (
    <ul>{users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}</ul>
  );
  ```

#### Best Practices:
- Choose patterns based on the specific use case
