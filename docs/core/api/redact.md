## Advanced Configuration Options

### Multiple Source Types
```yaml
policies:
  - name: Redact-Multiple-Sources
    type: Redact
    configuration:
      source: both # Applies to both request and response
      content:
        - element: JSONPayload
          paths:
            - path: $.*.password
              replaceWith: "********"
```

### Variable Redaction
```yaml
policies:
  - name: Redact-Variables
    type: Redact
    configuration:
      source: request
      variables:
        - name: request.header.Authorization
          replaceWith: "[REDACTED]"
        - name: request.queryparam.apiKey
          replaceWith: "**********"
```

### Conditional Redaction
```yaml
policies:
  - name: Conditional-Redact
    type: Redact
    configuration:
      source: response
      condition: response.status.code = 200
      content:
        - element: JSONPayload
          paths:
            - path: $.data.secureInfo
              replaceWith: "[REDACTED]"
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Regex Complexity**: Complex patterns can impact performance
2. **Processing Order**: Position in policy chain affects overall latency
3. **Payload Size**: Large payloads take longer to scan and redact
4. **Selective Application**: Apply only to flows that contain sensitive data

## Environment-Specific Configuration

```yaml
environments:
  - name: prod
    policies:
      - name: Redact-Sensitive-Data
        configuration:
          enabled: true
  - name: dev
    policies:
      - name: Redact-Sensitive-Data
        configuration:
          enabled: false # Disable in development for debugging
```

## Compliance Documentation

When implementing redaction policies, document:
- Types of data being redacted
- Justification for redaction (compliance requirements)
- Validation procedures
- Audit process for verifying proper implementation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create test cases with sample sensitive data
2. Verify redaction occurs correctly for all patterns
3. Test edge cases (partial matches, boundary conditions)
4. Benchmark performance impact
5. Include in CI/CD automated test suite

## Integration with Other Security Measures

Combine Redact policy with:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- API key validation
- Threat protection policies
- Content validation
- Access control policies

This comprehensive approach ensures sensitive data is protected throughout the API lifecycle, from request authentication to response delivery.
