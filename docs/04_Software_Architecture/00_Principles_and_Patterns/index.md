# Software Architecture Principles and Patterns

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of software architecture principles, patterns, and best practices.

## Core Knowledge Areas

### System Design Fundamentals
- **Distributed Systems**: CAP Theorem, ACID vs BASE, Eventual Consistency, Distributed Caching, Message Queues, Load Balancing.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling, Database Sharding, Partitioning, Replication Strategies.
- **High Availability**: Failover Mechanisms, Disaster Recovery, Redundancy, Circuit Breakers, Health Monitoring.

### Architecture Patterns
- **Monolithic Architecture**: N-tier, Modular Monolith.
- **Microservices**: Service Discovery, API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, CQRS, Event Sourcing.
- **Cloud Native**: 12-Factor App, Containerization, Orchestration, Service Mesh.

### Design Patterns
- **Enterprise Integration Patterns**: Message Patterns, Routing Patterns, Transformation Patterns.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Strategic Design, Tactical Design, Bounded Contexts, Aggregates.
