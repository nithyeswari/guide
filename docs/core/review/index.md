## Introduction

Code review is a systematic examination of source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked during the development phase. It's one of the most effective quality assurance techniques that helps in:
- Improving code quality
- Finding bugs early
- Knowledge sharing within teams
- Maintaining coding standards
- Mentoring junior developers

This document provides comprehensive resources to help you conduct more effective code reviews.

## Best Practices for Code Review

### General Principles
1. **Review for maximum 60-90 minutes at a time** - Mental fatigue sets in after this point
2. **Limit review size to 200-400 lines** - Smaller reviews are more effective
3. **Have a clear purpose** - Define what you're looking for in each review
4. **Use checklists** - Ensure consistency in review process
5. **Separate style from substance** - Use automated tools for style checking
6. **Be respectful and constructive** - Focus on the code, not the coder

### The Code Review Mindset
- Ask questions instead of making statements
- Explain the reasoning behind your suggestions
- Praise good code and solutions
- Focus on sharing knowledge, not criticizing
- Remember that different doesn't mean wrong

### When Conducting Reviews
- Start with a broad overview, then dive into details
- Look for design issues before coding issues
- Consider readability and maintainability
- Check for edge cases and error handling
- Verify test coverage and test quality
