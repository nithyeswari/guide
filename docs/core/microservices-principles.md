# Core Microservices Principles

## 1. Single Responsibility (Service Independence)
Each microservice should be responsible for one specific business capability:
- Focused on a single business domain
- Independent deployability
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Autonomous data management
- Separate codebase

### Benefits
- Easier maintenance
- Simplified testing
- Reduced dependencies
- Clear team ownership
- Faster development cycles

## 2. Loose Coupling
Services should have minimal dependencies on each other:
- Asynchronous communication when possible
- Event-driven architecture
- API contracts
- No shared databases
- Independent evolution

### Benefits
- Reduced system fragility
- Easier updates
- Better fault isolation
- Independent scaling
- Technology flexibility

## 3. High Cohesion
Related functionality should be grouped together:
- Business-aligned boundaries
- Domain-driven design
- Strong module boundaries
- Clear service responsibility
- Unified data ownership

### Benefits
- Better maintainability
- Reduced cross-service calls
- Improved performance
- Clear team ownership
- Simplified development

## 4. Service Autonomy
Services should operate and evolve independently:
- Self-contained functionality
- Independent data storage
- Separate deployment pipelines
- Individual scaling
- Technology independence

### Benefits
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Faster deployment
- Better reliability
- Simplified maintenance
- Team autonomy

## 5. Design for Failure
Services should be resilient and handle failures gracefully:
- Circuit breakers
- Fallback mechanisms
- Timeout handling
- Retry policies
- Bulkhead pattern

### Benefits
- System resilience
- Better availability
- Fault isolation
- Graceful degradation
- Improved user experience

## 6. Decentralized Data Management
Each service manages its own data:
- Private databases
- No shared schemas
- Data duplication when needed
- Event-driven consistency
- Service-specific storage technology

### Benefits
- Data independence
- Reduced coupling
- Better scalability
- Technology flexibility
- Clear data ownership

## 7. Infrastructure Automation
Automate deployment and operational tasks:
- Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated testing
- Monitoring and alerting
- Auto-scaling

### Benefits
- Faster deployments
- Reduced errors
- Consistent environments
- Better reliability
- Efficient operations

## 8. API First Design
Design APIs before implementation:
- Clear contracts
- Version management
- Documentation
- Consumer-driven contracts
- Backward compatibility

### Benefits
- Better interfaces
- Clear boundaries
- Easier integration
- Improved maintainability
- Better developer experience

## 9. Security by Design
Build security into services from the start:
- Authentication/Authorization
- Secure communication
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Security monitoring

### Benefits
- Better security posture
- Reduced vulnerabilities
- Compliance
- Trust boundaries
- Risk management

## 10. Observability
Enable comprehensive monitoring and debugging:
- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Metrics collection
- Health monitoring
- Performance analysis

### Benefits
- Better troubleshooting
- System visibility
- Performance optimization
- Problem prevention
- Faster resolution

## 11. Event-Driven Architecture
Use events for service communication:
- Message queues
- Event sourcing
- Publish/subscribe patterns
- Asynchronous processing
- Event-driven workflows

### Benefits
- Better decoupling
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Audit capability
- Real-time processing

## 12. Domain-Driven Design
Align services with business domains:
- Bounded contexts
- Ubiquitous language
- Domain models
- Business alignment
- Clear boundaries

### Benefits
- Better business alignment
- Clear boundaries
- Reduced complexity
- Improved communication
- Better maintainability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development
- Use containerization
- Implement API gateways
- Apply service discovery
- Use circuit breakers
- Implement health checks

### Testing
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Contract testing
- End-to-end testing
- Chaos testing

### Deployment
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary releases
- Feature toggles
- Rolling updates
- Infrastructure as Code

### Monitoring
- Log aggregation
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Alert management

### Security
- Identity management
- Access control
- Network security
- Data protection
- Security monitoring

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. Shared Databases
- Violates independence
- Creates coupling
- Limits evolution

2. Synchronous Communication Chains
- Reduces reliability
- Increases latency
- Creates dependencies

3. Direct Database Access
- Bypasses business logic
- Creates coupling
- Violates encapsulation

4. Lack of API Versioning
- Breaking changes
- Difficult updates
- Poor maintainability

5. Monolithic Data Models
- Tight coupling
- Limited evolution
- Complex dependencies
