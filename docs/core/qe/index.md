## Types of Software Testing

### Unit Testing
- **Definition**: Testing individual components or functions in isolation
- **Best Practices**:
  - Tests should be independent and isolated
  - One assertion per test
  - Use descriptive test names (e.g., "should_return_correct_total_when_adding_valid_numbers")
  - Tests should be fast to execute
  - Mock dependencies
- **Industry Standard**: 70-80% code coverage for critical components

### Integration Testing
- **Definition**: Testing the interaction between integrated components
- **Best Practices**:
  - Test in an environment similar to production
  - Test all integration points
  - Use real dependencies when possible, mocks when necessary
  - Test both happy and error paths

### Functional Testing
- **Definition**: Testing application functionality against requirements
- **Best Practices**:
  - Test scenarios based on user stories or requirements
  - Include both positive and negative test cases
  - Organize tests by features or workflows

### End-to-End Testing
- **Definition**: Testing entire application workflows from start to finish
- **Best Practices**:
  - Focus on critical user journeys
  - Minimize the number of E2E tests (they're slow and brittle)
  - Run on production-like environments
  - Use data setup and tear-down procedures

### Performance Testing
- **Definition**: Testing system performance under various conditions
- **Types**:
  - Load Testing: System behavior under expected load
  - Stress Testing: System behavior under extreme conditions
  - Endurance Testing: System behavior over extended periods
  - Spike Testing: System behavior with sudden increases in load
- **Best Practices**:
  - Define clear performance criteria
  - Use realistic test data and scenarios
  - Isolate the test environment
  - Monitor system resources during tests

### Security Testing
- **Definition**: Testing for vulnerabilities and security weaknesses
- **Types**:

### Regression Testing
- **Definition**: Testing to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
- **Best Practices**:
  - Automate regression test suites
  - Prioritize tests for critical features
  - Run regression tests after each significant change

## Testing Methodologies

### Agile Testing
- Core principles:
  - Testing is not a phase but an ongoing activity
  - Whole team approach to quality
  - Early and continuous feedback
  - Automation is essential
- Practices:
  - Test-driven development
  - Continuous integration
  - Automated regression testing
  - Exploratory testing

### Shift-Left Testing
- Start testing earlier in the development lifecycle
- Involves developers in testing activities
- Detect and fix issues when they're cheaper to resolve
- Practices:
  - Static code analysis
  - Unit testing during development
  - Early integration testing

### Exploratory Testing
- Simultaneous learning, test design, and execution
- Less scripted, more creative approach
- Focuses on discovery and investigation
- Best for complex systems or when requirements are unclear

## Modern Testing Strategy Overview

### 1. The Testing Trophy Approach
- **Static Analysis (Base)**
  - **Tools**: ESLint/TSLint, SonarQube, Pylint/Mypy, StyleCop/FxCop, Checkstyle
  - **Sustainability**: Low resource consumption, can run pre-commit
  - **Performance**: Very fast (milliseconds to seconds)

- **Unit Tests (Lower Middle)**
  - **Tools**: Jest/Mocha, JUnit/TestNG, pytest/unittest, NUnit/xUnit, RSpec
  - **Sustainability**: Minimal resources, can run in CI on every commit
  - **Performance**: Fast execution (seconds), should run in under 2 minutes

- **Integration Tests (Largest Portion)**
  - **Tools**: Supertest/Axios, RestAssured, Requests, Testcontainers, Pactflow
  - **Sustainability**: Moderate resource usage, containerization reduces environmental impact
  - **Performance**: Medium speed (seconds to minutes), parallelize when possible

- **End-to-End Tests (Top)**
  - **Tools**: Cypress/Playwright/Selenium, Appium, Cucumber, Postman/Newman
  - **Sustainability**: Higher resource usage, run in batches rather than on every commit
  - **Performance**: Slower (minutes), optimize with parallel execution and headless browsers

### 2. Shift-Left Testing
- **Requirements Validation**
  - **Tools**: Cucumber/SpecFlow, Jira/Azure DevOps, Confluence/GitBook
  - **Sustainability**: Low computational resources
  - **Performance**: Front-loaded effort that saves significant time later

- **Developer Testing**
  - **Tools**: IDE plugins, Wallaby.js, Test coverage tools (Istanbul, JaCoCo)
  - **Sustainability**: Reduces waste by catching issues early
  - **Performance**: Fast feedback loops increase development velocity

### 3. Risk-Based Testing
- **Risk Assessment**
  - **Tools**: Risk matrices, TestRail, PractiTest
  - **Sustainability**: Focuses resources where they deliver most value
  - **Performance**: Optimizes effort allocation for maximum quality impact

- **Critical Path Testing**
  - **Tools**: New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics, Google Analytics
  - **Sustainability**: Targeted testing reduces unnecessary resource consumption
  - **Performance**: Ensures critical paths are optimized for users

### 4. Contract-Based Testing
- **API Contract Testing**
  - **Tools**: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract, Swagger/OpenAPI validators
  - **Sustainability**: Reduces integration issues, enables independent deployments
  - **Performance**: Fast tests that run in isolation

- **Service Virtualization**
  - **Tools**: Mountebank, WireMock, Hoverfly, Microcks
  - **Sustainability**: Reduces need for full test environments
  - **Performance**: Tests run without real backend dependencies

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### TDD Cycle
- **Red**: Write a failing test
- **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
- **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

### Benefits
