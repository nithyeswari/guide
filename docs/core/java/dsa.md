## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### Before the Interview
1. **Practice consistently** - Code every day, even if just for 30 minutes
2. **Focus on patterns** - Learn to recognize common problem types
3. **Time yourself** - Practice solving problems within 45 minutes
4. **Explain your thinking** - Always verbalize your approach

### During the Interview
1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Understand the problem completely
2. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize your solution
3. **Think out loud** - Share your thought process
4. **Test your code** - Walk through examples manually
5. **Handle edge cases** - Consider null inputs, empty arrays, etc.

### Common Mistake to Avoid
- Don't memorize solutions - understand the underlying patterns
- Don't jump to coding immediately - think through the approach first
- Don't ignore time/space complexity - always analyze your solution
- Don't give up too quickly - work through problems step by step
